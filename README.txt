  Hey Angelica,
  I found some files for a shield template for the mega. 
  If you have altium, or CAD (might need to convert the file) 
  you can view what the layout will look like. Otherwise just
  know it'll be a clean way for most of our sensors to fit 
  compactly on top of the mega. I put all the new files in a
  seperate branch. (I hope)
